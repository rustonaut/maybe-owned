**provides a `MaybeOwned<'a,T>` type different to std's `Cow` it implements `From<T>` and `From<&'a T>` and does not require `ToOwned`**

---

This crate provides a `MaybeOwned<'a,T>` enum. Different to `std::borrow::Cow` it
implements `From<T>` and `From<&'a T>` and does not require a `ToOwned` implementation.
While this can be nice for API's mainly consuming `T`'s not implementing `ToOwned` or implementing
`ToOwned` through `Clone` it also means it's borrowed version of `String` is
`&String` and not `&str` making it less performant for cases like `String` or `Vec`.


Documentation can be [viewed on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/maybe-owned).


## Example

Take a look at the [examples dir](./examples) and the documentation
for more complete examples.

The main benefit of `MaybeOwned` over `Cow` is for API design,
allowing API consumer to pass in both `T` and `&'a T`:

```rust

//... in a trait implementation
    fn register<D>(&mut self, key: SomeId, data: D)
        where D: Into<MaybeOwned<'a, Data>>
    {
        self.map.entry(key).or_insert_with(||data.into());
    }
//...

//... in usage
    // use owned data
    registry.register(id1, data_owned);
    // use a reference to the data
    registry.register(id2, &data_ref);
    // it ok to use the same reference again
    registry.register(id3, &data_ref);
//...
```

## Change Log

- `pending` (0.4?,1.0?)
  - Added `Cow` from `MaybeOwned` implementation
  - Removed deprecated method (`to_mut`)
  - Extended impl. of `PartialOrd` to allow other
    right hand side types.
  - Feature gates transitive ops implementations
    (and marked them as unstable).
  - Transitive ops implementations now return a
    `MaybeOwend`/`MaybeOwnedMut` as to be more
    consistent with other API's and allow Things
    like `a + b + c`.

- `v0.3.4`:
  - Added `make_owned()` as a `to_mut()` replacement,
    but also available for `MaybeOwnedMut` and more
    clear in it's functionality.
  - Added a `as_mut()` method to `MaybeOwned` which
    return a `Option<&mut T>`
  - Added missing `BorrowMut` implementation
    for `MaybeOwnedMut`


- `v0.3.3`:
  - added `MaybeOwnedMut`

- `v0.3.2`:
  - added transitive `std::ops` implementations

- `v0.3.1`:
  - added `serde` support
