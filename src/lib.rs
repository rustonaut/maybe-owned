/// This type provides a way to store data to which you either have a
/// reference to or which you do own.
///
/// It provides `From<T>`, `From<&'a T>` implementations and, in difference
/// to `Cow` does _not_ require `ToOwned` to be implemented which makes it
/// compatible with non cloneable data, as a draw back of this it does not
/// know about `ToOwned`. As a consequence of it can't know that `&str` should
/// be the borrowed version of `String` and not `&String` this is especially
/// bad wrt. `Box` as the borrowed version of `Box<T>` would be `&Box<T>`.
///
/// While this crate has some drawbacks compared to `Cow` is has the benefit,
/// that it works with Types which neither implement `Clone` nor `ToOwned`.
/// Another benefit lies in the ability to write API functions which accept
/// a generic parameter `E: Into<MaybeOwned<'a, T>>` as the API consumer can
/// pass `T`, `&'a T` and `MaybeOwned<'a, T>` as argument, without requiring
/// a explicit `Cow::Owned` or a split into two functions one accepting
/// owed and the other borrowed values.
///
/// # Alternatives
///
/// If you mainly have values implementing `ToOwned` like `&str`/`String`, `Path`/`PathBuf` or
/// `&[T]`/`Vec<T>` using `std::borrow::Cow` might be preferable.
///
/// If you want to be able to treat `&T`, `&mut T`, `Box<T>` and `Arc<T>` the same
/// consider using [`reffers::rbma::RBMA`](https://docs.rs/reffers)
/// (through not all types/platforms are supported because
/// as it relies on the fact that for many pointers the lowest two bits are 0, and stores
/// the discriminant in them, nevertheless this is can only be used with 32bit-aligned data,
/// e.g. using a &u8 _might_ fail). RBMA also allows you to recover a `&mut T` if it was created
/// from `Box<T>`, `&mut T` or a unique `Arc`.
///
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use maybe_owned::MaybeOwned;
/// struct PseudoBigData(u8);
/// fn pseudo_register_fn<'a, E>(_val: E) where E: Into<MaybeOwned<'a, PseudoBigData>> { }

/// Adding implementations for Ops which add a `MaybeOwned` to
